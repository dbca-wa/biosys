            <p>BioSys – the Western Australian Biological Survey Database – is a web-based repository for the
                Department’s biological survey data.
                The system at Version 1.0 is currently a proof-of-concept,
                funded by the <a
                        href="http://www.dbca.wa.gov.au/management/kimberley-strategy/conserving-the-unique-kimberley-environment/164-the-landscape-conservation-initiative">Kimberley
                    Landscape Conservation Initiative (LCI)</a>, and supporting that initiative’s immediate data
                requirements.
            </p>

            <p>
                Biological survey databases typically manage highly complex and structured data.
                In this initial version we have implemented data fields and workflow to specifically support the
                Kimberley LCI.
                In future versions, resources permitting, BioSys will be extended to support a much broader range of
                ecological data types and sampling protocols, including localised and regional survey snapshots.
            </p>

            <p>
                BioSys runs in a web browser within the Department’s internal network.
                Data is currently uploaded to the system via supplied spreadsheet templates, permitting offline data
                entry.
                Published BioSys data can be downloaded by any authorised staff member via their normal login. Data will
                also be warehoused in NatureMap, subject to custodial approval.

            <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

            <p>
                BioSys was developed at the instigation of the Director, Science and Conservation Division (SCD) using
                LCI funding.
                It was a key deliverable of the Office of Information Management’s (OIM) Knowledge Management
                Initiative, a highly successful joint venture between SCD, OIM and other sections of the Department.
                Both SCD and OIM contributed significant in-kind resources to this project, including project management
                and user liaison. Gaia Resources and OIM provided system development.
